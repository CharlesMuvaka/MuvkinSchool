                    <h3>Where Programming lives.</h3>
                    <p>Muvkin School was founded in 2022 in Kenya. It was began due to the increasing demands from technology 
                        without people to implement it. The original thought was to make it a free technological school used to support 
                        street children across the country. Other students willing to cater for all the costs are also welcomed inorder 
                        to support diversity in the school.
                    </p>
                    <p>Due to the surging rise of technological advancements around the globe, Muvkin School is distrubuted across 
                        the continent. Each African country has four schools in it with Kenya having the highest number of schools. One school is 
                        entirely reserved for disabled students.
