                    <h3>Where Programming lives.</h3>
                    <p>Muvkin School was founded in 2022 in Kenya. It was began due to the increasing demands from technology 
                        without people to implement it. The original thought was to make it a free technological school used to support 
                        street children across the country. Other students willing to cater for all the costs are also welcomed inorder 
                        to support diversity in the school.
                    </p>
                    <p>To promote the schools culture students must sign in to do the opening term quiz which consists of five questions.</p>
